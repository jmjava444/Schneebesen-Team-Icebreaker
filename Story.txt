Shrek was in a new stage of his life, while Fiona was still asleep he decided to take his hund out for a walk around the swamp.
During his walk, Shrek noticed that a new Bäckerei has opened up offering many Gebäck.
While waiting in line he overheard the song Du Hast by Rammstein.
Donkey burst in and yelled "Shrek, Shrek, you won't believe what I just saw, I'm just going to tell you it's the largest Schloss I've ever seen Fiona would even be impressed." 
Once Shrek heard this, he jumped in the first Porsche he saw with Donkey and raced to the Flughafen. 
Somehow, they made it to the Berlin airport in record time and boarded their flight to travel to the world's largest lock (apparently Shrek used to be a locksmith).
During their flight, Donkey was already daydreaming out loud, saying "I hope we stop by the Raesfeld, they have got this Bratwurst the size of my head! And a biergarten too! I'm starving just thinking about it."
Suddenly, Donkey hears a familiar voice whispering behind him, it's Puss in Boots, Donkey turns around and sees he is wearing Fiona's dirndel!
Shrek looks at Puss and asks, "Whats with the dirndel" to which Puss states, "Ehh, they were out of lederhose."
As the plane landed, Shrek, Donkey, and Puss jumped off the plane before it fully stopped, but not before grabbing a Döner and some Apfelkuchen from the stewardess.
As they landed, Shrek spotted a Porsche parked near the Hauptstrasse, and Donkey yelled, 'Perfect! Let's grab some Apfelkuchen for the road!
